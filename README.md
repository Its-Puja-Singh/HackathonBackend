An
electronic
health
record

EHR

is


digital
version
of


patient‚Äôs
paper
chart

EHRs
are
real
time

patient
centered
records
that
make
information
available
instantly
and
securely
to
authorized
users

While
an
EHR
does
contain
the
medical
and
treatment
histories
of
patients

an
EHR
system
is
built
to
go
beyond
standard
clinical
data
collected
in


provider‚Äôs
office
and
can
be
inclusive
of


broader
view
of


patient‚Äôs
care

EHRs
are


vital
part
of
health
IT
and
can


Contain


patient‚Äôs
medical
history

diagnoses

medications

treatment
plans

immunization
dates

allergies

radiology
images

and
laboratory
and
test
results
Allow
access
to
evidence
based
tools
that
providers
can
use
to
make
decisions
about


patient‚Äôs
care
Automate
and
streamline
provider
workflow
One
of
the
key
features
of
an
EHR
is
that
health
information
can
be
created
and
managed
by
authorized
providers
in


digital
format
capable
of
being
shared
with
other
providers
across
more
than
one
health
care
organization

EHRs
are
built
to
share
information
with
other
health
care
providers
and
organizations


such
as
laboratories

specialists

medical
imaging
facilities

pharmacies

emergency
facilities

and
school
and
workplace
clinics


so
they
contain
information
from
all
clinicians
involved
in


patient‚Äôs
care


An
electronic
health
record

EHR

is
the
systematized
collection
of
patient
and
population
electronically
stored
health
information
in


digital
format




These
records
can
be
shared
across
different
health
care
settings

Records
are
shared
through
network
connected

enterprise
wide
information
systems
or
other
information
networks
and
exchanges

EHRs
may
include


range
of
data

including
demographics

medical
history

medication
and
allergies

immunization
status

laboratory
test
results

radiology
images

vital
signs

personal
statistics
like
age
and
weight

and
billing
information





For
several
decades

electronic
health
records

EHRs

have
been
touted
as
key
to
increasing
of
quality
care




Electronic
health
records
are
used
for
other
reasons
than
charting
for
patients




today

providers
are
using
data
from
patient
records
to
improve
quality
outcomes
through
their
care
management
programs

EHR
combines
all
patients
demographics
into


large
pool

and
uses
this
information
to
assist
with
the
creation
of
‚Äúnew
treatments
or
innovation
in
healthcare
delivery‚Äù
which
overall
improves
the
goals
in
healthcare




Combining
multiple
types
of
clinical
data
from
the
system


health
records
has
helped
clinicians
identify
and
stratify
chronically
ill
patients

EHR
can
improve
quality
care
by
using
the
data
and
analytics
to
prevent
hospitalizations
among
high
risk
patients


EHR
systems
are
designed
to
store
data
accurately
and
to
capture
the
state
of


patient
across
time

It
eliminates
the
need
to
track
down


patient


previous
paper
medical
records
and
assists
in
ensuring
data
is
up
to
date




accurate
and
legible

It
also
allows
open
communication
between
the
patient
and
the
provider
